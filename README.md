4.	HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION INTERFACES
IMPLEMENTATION: 
Visual Interfaces: Displays, maps, and alerts can be used to convey the robot's state and surroundings. 
Audio Interfaces: Voice commands and auditory feedback can be used for control and confirmation. 
Tactile Interfaces: Haptic feedback can provide information on the robot's status and actions. 
5.	 PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING
IMPLEMENTATION:
Behaviour-Based Approaches: These approaches use rules and heuristics to make decisions based on the current situation. 
Behaviour Planning: This involves determining the desired driving behavior (e.g., accelerating, decelerating, changing lanes) based on the perceived environment and the overall goal.
OUTCOME:
Planning and decision-making in autonomous vehicles and robotics is the ability to navigate complex environments safely and efficiently, while adapting to changing conditions. This includes generating. optimal routes, making tactical maneuvers, and controlling the vehicle's motion.
